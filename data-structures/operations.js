  search: {
    notation: 'SEARCH (S, k)',
    description: 'A query that, given a set S and a key value k, returns a pointer x to an element in S such that x:key D k, or NIL if no such element belongs to S.'

    notation: 'INSERT (S, x)',
    description: 'A modifying operation that augments the set S with the element pointed to by x. We usually assume that any attributes in element x needed by the set implementation have already been initialized.'

    description: 'A query that, given an element x whose key is from a totally ordered set S, returns a pointer to the next smaller element in S, or NIL if x is the minimum element.'
  }
}

For a set on n keys, the normal presumption is that a call to MINIMUM followed by n Ùè∞ê 1 calls to SUCCESSOR enumerates the elements in the set in sorted order.
